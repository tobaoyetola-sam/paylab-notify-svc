# paylab-notify-svc

Part of **PayLab** (aricxpoint DevOps class: "Payment Web App Deployment").

The lab stand-in for an email/SMS service. `POST /notify` prints JSON **receipt** lines to stdout
(which end up in CloudWatch Logs on AWS) and returns 202. No database. Internal only.

- successful payment: a **sent** receipt for the payer and a **received** receipt for the payee,
- failed payment: one **failed** receipt for the payer.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8083` |

## Run it alone with Docker

```bash
docker build -t paylab/notify-svc .
docker run --rm --name notify-svc -p 8083:8083 paylab/notify-svc

# in another terminal
curl -s -X POST localhost:8083/notify -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"paymentId":1,"reference":"ref-1","status":"success","amountKobo":150000,"note":"Lunch","payer":{"walletId":1,"handle":"ada"},"payee":{"walletId":2,"handle":"bola"}}'
```

## Deployment (AWS)

This repo is deployed by its own **CodePipeline** `paylab-notify-svc-pipeline` on every push to `main`:

```
git push (main) -> CodePipeline Source -> CodeBuild (buildspec.yml) -> ECR paylab/notify-svc:<commit> -> ECS service "notify-svc" in cluster "paylab"
```

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `buildspec.yml` | CodeBuild steps: log in to ECR, build, push `:<short-commit>` and `:latest`, write `imagedefinitions.json`. |
| `taskdef.json` | ECS task definition template (with `<ACCOUNT_ID>`-style placeholders). Registered by `paylab-infra/terraform` (`ecs.tf`); the pipeline then registers a new revision on every deploy. |

The container name in `taskdef.json` and in `imagedefinitions.json` is `notify-svc`. They **must match**, or the deploy stage fails.

The shared AWS setup (network, database, cluster, load balancer, pipelines) lives in the **paylab-infra** repo.
